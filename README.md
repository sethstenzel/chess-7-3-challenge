# The Chess Suite 3-7 Challenge
This challenge is an epic developer challenge. I expect it will take many years to complete.
The challenge is to create a network enable chess application. Here are the requirements for the challenge:

Create a feature-rich platform for playing and observing chess games with user management and real-time interaction.

This platform must be written in the following **7** languages:
Python
Javascript
Go
C
C++
Rust
Assembly (ASM)

This platform must be runnable on the following **3** operating systems:
Linux
Windows
MacOS

Finally Servers and Clients should work together reguardlesss of their language or plateform.
This means that a Server written in C++ running on MacOS should works with a Javascript Client running on Windows.

# Summary
2 Applications, written 7 times, in 7 languages, on 3 different modern operating systems. 

# But why?
Because I like setting large goals, and doing this well will give me self validation.
If I can create this, in 7 different languages, I can do anything **flex**.
